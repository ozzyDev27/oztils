# Functions
### nonIndexedRange
nonIndexedRange takes an input of an int, and returns a range type. 
When you use range(3), it makes a list of [0,1,2], but when you use nonIndexedRange(3), it returns [1,2,3]
### invert
Takes a single input (preferrably a string, but can be anything) and returns what it is reversed.
For example, "Hello" would return "olleH".
